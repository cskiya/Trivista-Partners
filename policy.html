            <p>Privacy is of utmost importance at the Trustexfussion companies. We recognise the
                significance of protecting information which is stored on our servers or network or is intended to be
                stored on our servers or network and which relates to an individual. The data we protect are the
                “Personal Data” which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person,
                sometimes called a data subject, and have made protecting the privacy and the confidentiality of
                Personal Data a fundamental component of the way we do business. This Privacy Policy informs you of the
                ways we work to ensure privacy and the confidentiality of Personal Data and describes the information we
                gather, how we use those Personal Data and the circumstances under which we disclose such information to
                third-parties.
                This Privacy Policy is designed to address regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which
                Trustexfussion offers its Services, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), as enacted
                by the European Commission. In this Privacy Policy, the term “Service” and “Services” has the same
                meaning as described in the User Agreement, but excludes API services, which are governed by a separate
                agreement. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, in general, or any part of it, you should not
                use the Services. This Privacy Policy is periodically reviewed to ensure that any new obligations and
                changes to our business model are taken into consideration. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time
                by posting an amended version on our website.
                1. Information About Trustexfussion
                Our Services are offered through one or more subsidiaries of Trustexfussion Luxembourg S.A. By using the
                Services, you understand that your Personal Data may be used by one of the following entities (each, a
                “Controller”):
                • Trustexfussion Access UK; and
            </p>

            <p>2. Collection of Personal Data
                When you access or use the Services, we collect the following information:
                Information you may provide to us: You may give us information about you by filling in forms on our
                website or through our app or by corresponding with us by phone, email or otherwise. This includes
                information you provide when you register to use the Services and when you report a problem with the
                website or with our app.
                Information we collect about you: With regard to each of your visits to our website or our app we
                automatically collect the following information:
                • Login Information: We log technical information about your use of the Services, including the type of
                browser and version you use, the wallet identifier, the last access time of your wallet, the Internet
                Protocol (IP) address used to create the wallet and the most recent IP address used to access the
                wallet.
                • Device Information: We collect information about the device you use to access your account, including
                the hardware model, operating system and version, and unique deviWe ce identifiers, but this information
                is anonymised and not tied to any particular person.
                • Wallet Information: If you create a Trustexfussion Wallet through our Services, you will generate a
                public and private key pair. When you log-out of the Wallet, we collect an encrypted file that, if
                unencrypted, would contain these keys, along with your transaction history. When you enable
                notifications through your Account Settings, we will collect the unencrypted public key in order to
                provide such notifications. Under no circumstances do we collect an unencrypted private key from you,
                nor can we decrypt any Wallet file data.
                • Transaction Information: In connection with our Conversion Service, as such term is defined in our
                User Agreement, we may collect and maintain information relating to transactions you effect in your
                Wallet that convert one virtual currency to another (e.g. Bitcoin for Ether).
                Information We Collect Required By Law, Rule, or Regulation: Depending on the Service, we may collect
                information from you in order to meet regulatory obligations around know-your-customer (“KYC”) and
                anti-money laundering (“AML”) requirements. Information that we collect from you includes the following:

                • Residential address
                • Contact details (telephone number, email address)
                • Date and place of birth, gender, place of citizenship
                • Bank account information and/or credit card details
                • Your status as a politically exposed person
                • Source of funds & proof of address

                identity
                • Transaction history and account balances in connection with your use of certain Services.
                Information We Collect from Other Sources: We also receive information from other sources and combine
                that with the information we collect through our Services. For instance:

                provided that those data cannot identify any individual.
                We also use third-party web analytics tools that help us understand how users engage with our website.
                These third-parties may use first-party cookies to track user interactions to collect information about
                how users use our website. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our
                website. The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt-out of
                such third-party analytic tools without affecting how you visit our site. For more information on
                opting-out, please contact support.
                We will process your Personal Data legally and fairly and not use it outside the purposes of which we
                have informed you, including selling it individually or in the aggregate for commercial use.
            </p>

            <p> 4. Disclosure of Personal Data
                We may share your information with selected recipients to perform functions required to provide certain
                Services to you and/or in connection with our efforts to prevent and investigate fraudulent or other
                criminal activity. All such third parties will be contractually bound to protect data in compliance with
                our Privacy Policy. The categories of recipients include:
                • Companies within the Trustexfussion corporate family located in the United States, the United Kingdom,
                and the EEA in order to provide the Services to you.
                • Cloud service providers to store certain personal data and for disaster recovery services, as well as,
                for the performance of any contract we enter into with you.
                • Fraud detection service providers who will run certain fraud detection checks against Personal Data
                provided.
                • Spam and abuse detection providers making software available designed to prevent users from
                programatically using the Services in unsupported ways.
                We also may share Personal Data with a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture,
                restructuring, reorganisation, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of Trustexfussion’s
                assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which
                Personal Data held by Trustexfussion is among the assets transferred.
                Except where we are required by law to disclose Personal Data, or are exempted from, released from or
                not subject to any legal requirement concerning the disclosure of Personal Data, we will require any
                person to whom we provide your Personal Data to agree to comply with our Privacy Policy in force at that
                time or requirements substantially similar to such policy. We will make reasonable commercial efforts to
                ensure that they comply with such policy or requirements, however, where not expressly prohibited by
                law, we will have no liability to you, if any person fails to do so.
                We shall require any third-party, including without limitation, any government or enforcement entity,
                seeking access to the data we hold to a court order, or equivalent proof that they are statutorily
                authorised to access your data and that their request is valid and within their statutory or regulatory
                power.
                Funding and transaction information related to your use of certain Services may be recorded on a public
                block chain. Public block chains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions
                across wide networks of computer systems. Many block chains are open to forensic analysis which can lead
                to deanonymisation and the unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when
                block chain data is combined with other data.
                Because block chains are decentralised or third-party networks that are not controlled or operated by
                Trustexfussion or its affiliates, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter Personal Data from such
                networks
            </p>

            <p> 5. Security of Your Personal Data
                We protect Personal Data with appropriate physical, technological and organisational safeguards and
                security measures. Your Personal Data comes to us via the internet which chooses its own routes and
                means, whereby information is conveyed from location to location. We audit our procedures and security
                measures regularly to ensure they are being properly administered and remain effective and appropriate.
                Every member of Trustexfussion is committed to our privacy policies and procedures to safeguard Personal
                Data. Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorised
                alteration of the information under our control. More specifically, our server uses TLS (Transport Layer
                Security) security protection by encrypting your Personal Data to prevent individuals from accessing
                such Personal Data as it travels over the internet.
                6. Retention of Your Personal Data
                The length of time we retain Personal Data outside our back-up system varies depending on the purpose
                for which it was collected and used, as follows:
                • Data you provide to us when subscribing for our Services: while user remains active, stored in the
                England UK.
                • Country location data: while user remains active, stored in the England UK.
                • Data on your preferences: while user remains active, stored in the England UK.
                • IP address login: until subsequent login from a new IP, stored in the England UK.
                When Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, we will remove any
                details that identifies you or we will securely destroy the records, where permissible. However, we may
                need to maintain records for a significant period of time (after you cease using a particular Service)
                as mandated by regulation. For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws that
                require us to retain the following, for a period of five (5) years after our business relationship with
                you has ended.
                • A copy of the records we used in order to comply with our client due diligence obligations;
                • Supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us.
                Except where prohibited by law, this period may extend beyond the end of the particular relationship
                with us, but only for as long as we are bound to do so for the audit, regulatory or other accounting
                purposes. When Personal Data is no longer needed, we have procedures either to destroy, delete, erase or
                convert it to an anonymous form. If you have opted-out of receiving marketing communications, we will
                hold your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these
                communications.
                After you have terminated the use of our Services, we reserve the right to maintain your Personal Data
                as part of our standard back-up procedures in an aggregated format.
            </p>

            <p> 7. Storage of Personal Data
                Trustexfussion stores your Personal Data at secure locations in the EU. Trustexfussion ensures that
                appropriate security standards are in place regarding the safeguarding, confidentiality, and security of
                Data.
                The information that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored in, destinations outside of
                your country and the European Economic Area ("EEA") as described below:
                We may transfer your Personal Data outside the EEA and the England UK to other company subsidiaries, service
                providers and business partners (i.e., Data Processors) who are engaged on our behalf. To the extent
                that we transfer your Personal Data outside of the EEA and England UK, we will ensure that the transfer is
                lawful and that Data Processors in third countries are obliged to comply with the GDPR and the England UK
                Data Protection Act 2018. If transfers of Personal Data are processed in the US, we may in some cases
                rely on applicable standard contractual clauses.
            </p>

            <p> 8. Your Rights
                The rights that are available to you in relation to the Personal Data we hold about you are outlined
                below.
                Information Access
                If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your Personal Data and, if so, what information
                we process and, if requested, provide you with a copy of that information within 30 days from the date
                of your request.
                Rectification
                It is important to us that your Personal Data is up-to-date. We will take all reasonable steps to make
                sure that your Personal Data remains accurate, complete and up-to-date. If the Personal Data we hold
                about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to have it rectified. If we have disclosed your
                Personal Data to others, we will let them know about the rectification where possible. If you ask us, if
                possible and lawful to do so, we will also inform you with whom we have shared your Personal Data so
                that you can contact them directly.
                You may inform us at any time that your personal details have changed by emailing support.
                comand we will change your Personal Data in accordance with your instructions. To
                proceed with such requests, in some cases we may need supporting documents from you as proof that we are
                required to keep for regulatory or other legal purposes.
                Erasure
                You can ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data in certain circumstances such as if we no longer
                need it, provided that we have no legal or regulatory obligation to retain that data. Such requests will
                be subject to any agreements that you have entered into with us, and to any retention limits, we are
                required to comply with in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we have disclosed your
                Personal Data to others, we will let them know about the erasure request where possible. If you ask us,
                if possible and lawful to do so, we will also inform you with whom we have shared your Personal Data so
                that you can contact them directly.
                Processing restrictions
                You can ask us to block or suppress the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances, such
                as, if you contest the accuracy of that Personal Data or object to us processing it. It will not stop us
                from storing your Personal Data. We will inform you before we decide not to agree with any requested
                restriction. If we have disclosed your Personal Data to others, we will let them know about the
                restriction of processing where possible. If you ask us, if possible and lawful to do so, we will also
                inform you with whom we have shared your Personal Data so that you can contact them directly.
                Data portability
                In certain circumstances, you might have the right to obtain Personal Data you have provided us with (in
                a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format) and to re-use it elsewhere or ask us to
                transfer this to a third party of your choice.
                Objection
                You can ask us to stop processing your Personal Data, and we will do so if we are:
                • Relying on our own or someone else’s legitimate interests to process your Personal Data, except if we
                can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing;
                • Processing your Personal Data for direct marketing; or
                • Processing your Personal Data for research, unless we reasonably believe such processing is necessary
                or prudent for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest (such as by a regulatory or
                enforcement agency).
                Automated decision-making and profiling
                If we make a decision about you based solely on an automated process (e.g. through automatic profiling)
                that affects your ability to access our Services or has another significant effect on you, you can
                request not to be subject to such a decision unless we can demonstrate to you that such a decision is
                necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between us. Even if a decision is
                necessary for entering into or performing a contract, you may contest the decision and require human
                intervention. We may not be able to offer our Services if we agree to such a request by terminating our
                relationship with you. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us at support.
            </p>

            <p>
