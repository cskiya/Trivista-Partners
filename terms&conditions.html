            <h4 class="boldText">4. THE WALLET</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Description</strong><br>
                The Wallet is provided to you exclusively by Trustexfussion.com DSwiss IT services. The Wallet is only
                capable of supporting certain Virtual Currencies. Under no circumstances should you attempt to store
                Virtual Currencies in your Wallet that the Wallet does not support.
                5.1.2 When you create a Wallet, the Wallet software generates a secured private and public key
                pair that you may use to send and receive any supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual
                Currency network. YOU MUST STORE, OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, A BACKUP OF ALL WALLET CREDENTIALS, INCLUDING
                YOUR PASSPHRASES, IDENTIFIERS, BACKUP PHRASES, PRIVATE KEYS AND NETWORK ADDRESSES. If you do not
                maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of the Services, you will not be able to access Virtual
                Currency previously accessed using your Wallet in the event that we discontinue or no longer offer some
                or all of the Services or may otherwise lose access to Virtual Currency. We are not responsible for
                maintaining this data on your behalf. <br>
                <strong>Trading Wallet</strong> <br>
                The Wallet will generally be made available on a non-custodial basis enabling you to self-custody your
                Virtual Currency. Any Virtual Currency you purchase using fiat currency in the Wallet will be held in
                the Trading Wallet. All Virtual Currency held in your Trading Wallet will be custodial assets held on
                trust by Trustexfussion.com for your benefit on a custodial basison trust for your benefit. Among other
                things, this means that:
                a. Title to the Virtual Currency shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to any
                company in the Trustexfussion.com Group. As the owner of Virtual Currency in your Trading Wallet, you shall
                bear all risk of loss of such Virtual Currency. Trustexfussion.com shall not have any liability for
                fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Virtual Currency held in your Trading Wallet.
                b. None of the Virtual Currencies in your Trading Wallet are the property of, or shall or may be loaned
                to, Trustexfussion.com; Trustexfussion.com does not represent or treat assets in a user’s Trading Wallet as
                belonging to Trustexfussion.com. Trustexfussion.com may not grant a security interest in the Virtual Currency
                held in your Trading Wallet. Except as required by a facially valid court order, or except as provided
                herein, Trustexfussion.com will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise alienate Virtual
                Currency in your Trading Wallet unless instructed by you or compelled by a court of competent
                jurisdiction to do so.
                c. You control the Virtual Currency held in your Trading Wallet. At any time, subject to outages,
                downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Virtual Currency by sending it to a
                different Trustexfussion address controlled by you or a third party. In the event you wish to transfer
                Virtual Currency into the Wallet, you may be prompted to set up a backup phrase in order to do so.
                d. In order to more securely custody assets, Trustexfussion.com may use shared Trustexfussion addresses,
                controlled by a member of the Trustexfussion.com Group, to hold Virtual Currencies held on behalf of
                customers and/or held on behalf of Trustexfussion.com. Your Virtual Currency is segregated from the
                Trustexfussion.com Group’s own Virtual Currency by way of separate ledger accounting entries for customer
                and Trustexfussion.com Group accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing,A although we maintain separate ledger
                accounting entries for customer and Trustexfussion.com accounts, no member of the Trustexfussion.com Group
                shall have any obligation to segregate by Trustexfussion address Virtual Currencies owned by you from
                Virtual Currencies owned by other customers or by any member of the Trustexfussion.com Group.
                e. We may store any Virtual Currency you deposit for use on Trustexfussion.com Exchange in a “hot wallet”,
                “cold wallet” or other storage method in our sole discretion.
                The Trading Wallet will be exclusively provided by Trustexfussion Access UK. <br>
                <strong>Minimum Holding Periods</strong> <br>
                When you place purchase orders in the Trading Wallet, we may impose minimum holding periods in respect
                of any Virtual Currency that you have purchased which may last up to a maximum of 7 days. These minimum
                holding periods are necessary to enable us to carry out effective fraud prevention measures and to
                ensure that the fiat currency leg of any given transaction has settled. After this minimum holding
                period elapses, you may trade your Virtual Currency in the ordinary way. <br>
                <strong>No Cancellation</strong> <br>
                You may not cancel, reverse or change any transaction in the Trading Wallet. We may suspend, delay,
                redirect, reverse or cancel any transaction at any time and for any reason. For example, and without
                limitation, we may do so if we suspect any risk of fraud, crime, breach of this User Agreement, or
                illicit activity. You will bear the costs of any network fees charged in respect of such suspension,
                delay, redirection, reversal or cancellation. <br>
                <strong>Transaction Limitation</strong> <br>
                We may implement transaction limits in the Trading Wallet. These may vary based on a variety of factors,
                including, without limitation, the time of your transaction, your location, the Virtual Currency
                purchased, and the Virtual Currency sold. We implement, raise and lower transaction limits in the
                Trading Wallet in our sole discretion. <br>
                <strong>Reversals of payment instructions and/or negative balances</strong> <br>
                If you reverse a payment instruction initiated with your bank, payment services provider or equivalent
                or part of a transaction fails for any reason which results in your Trading Wallet having a negative
                balance, we may liquidate any assets held in any account you hold with us (including the User Accounts)
                to offset and reduce the negative balance. You remain fully responsible for settling the balance and we
                may engage debt collectors to pursue any outstanding debt on our behalf. <br>
                
                In order to be completed, any Virtual Currency transaction created with the Wallet must be
                confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency
                network. Such networks are decentralised, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties,
                which are not owned, controlled or operated by Trustexfussion.com. <br>
                Trustexfussion.com has no control over any Virtual Currency network and therefore cannot and does not
                ensure that any transaction details you submit via our Services will be confirmed on the relevant
                Virtual Currency network. The transaction details you submit via our Services may not be completed, or
                may be substantially delayed, by the Virtual Currency network used to process the transaction. We do not
                guarantee that the Wallet can transfer title or right in any Virtual Currency or make any warranties
                whatsoever with regard to title. <br>
                Once transaction details have been submitted to a Virtual Currency network, we cannot assist you
                to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. Trustexfussion.com has no control
                over any Virtual Currency network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or
                modification requests. <br>
                
                <strong>No Password Retrieval</strong> <br>
                With respect to the Wallet, Trustexfussion.com does not receive or store your Wallet password, nor
                any keys, network addresses or transaction history. We cannot assist you with Wallet password retrieval.
                You are solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping secret your Wallet password. Any Virtual
                Currency you have associated with such Wallet may become inaccessible if you do not know or keep secret
                your Wallet password. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of your credentials (including,
                without limitation, a backup phrase, wallet identifier or password) can dispose of Virtual Currency in
                your Wallet <br>
                When you create a Wallet, you must: (a) create a strong password that you do not use for any other
                website or online service; (b) provide accurate and truthful information; (c) protect and keep secret
                all credentials for the Wallet; (d) protect access to your device and your Wallet; (e) promptly notify
                us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet; and (f) use the
                backup functionality provided through the Wallet and safeguard your backup files. You agree to take
                responsibility for all activities that occur with your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorised or
                unauthorised access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law. <br>
                <strong>Fees</strong> <br>
                Trustexfussion.com does not currently charge a fee for the Wallet receiving, sending or controlling Virtual
                Currency. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you
                any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. Network fees (including, without limitation “miner’s
                fees”) required to use a Virtual Currency network may apply to a transaction. We may attempt to
                calculate such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be excessive. You may
                select a greater or lesser fee. You are solely responsible for selecting and paying any such fee and
                Trustexfussion.com shall neither advance nor fund such a fee on your behalf, nor be responsible for any
                excess or insufficient fee calculation.
            </p>


            <h4 class="boldText">5. SWAP</h4>
            <p> 
                <strong>Description</strong><br>
                We may provide Swap to you using the Wallet interface. Swap is provided to you exclusively by
                Trustexfussion Access England. Through Swap, Trustexfussion.com shall display to you a conversion rate that
                may include a fee, which you agree to pay. Swap works in connection with the Wallet, by which we shall
                deliver to you the requested Virtual Currency, less any applicable fees, by executing a transaction from
                a Virtual Currency address we control to one associated with your Wallet. <br>
                <strong>Due Diligence</strong> <br>
                We may, at our sole discretion and from time-to-time, require you to satisfy our Compliance Program
                before participating in Swap or receiving funds. In order to use Swap, you agree to cooperate with any
                such request and pay any associated fees, which may be modified or supplemented at any time.
                

            <h4 class="boldText">6. GENERAL RISK FACTORS</h4>
            <p>
                Your use of the Services requires you to bear risks for which we cannot be held responsible. We list
                some, but not all of these risks below:
                a. Hardware, software or connections required to interact with a Virtual Currency network might fail,
                succumb to malware, unauthorised access or malicious attacks. Third parties may obtain unauthorised
                access to the Services, including, but not limited to your public and private keys. Trustexfussion.com
                shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you
                may experience when using the Services, however caused. <br>
                b. Forks, unknown vulnerabilities in or unanticipated changes to the network protocol may cause losses
                to you or others. Trustexfussion.com has no control over any Forex network and shall not be
                responsible for any harm occurring as a result of the inability to reverse a transaction, and any losses
                in connection therewith due to erroneous or fraudulent actions. <br>
                c. The risk of loss of value in using Services involving Virtual Currencies may be substantial and
                losses may occur over a short period of time. In addition, price and liquidity are subject to
                significant fluctuations that may be unpredictable. <br>
                d. Virtual Currencies are not legal tender and are not backed by any sovereign government. In addition,
                the legislative and regulatory landscape around Virtual Currencies is constantly changing and may affect
                your ability to use, transfer, or exchange Virtual Currencies. <br>
                e. When placing a “market order” in a Virtual Currency, your order will be executed immediately at the
                current market price. Market orders do not carry a limit price and will trade with anything on the order
                book. During periods of high volume, fast market conditions, illiquidity, or volatility in the
                marketplace, the actual price that a market order is executed at may be different from the best price
                indicated at the time of your order, and in some cases significantly so. <br>
                f. Under certain market conditions you may find it difficult to liquidate a position. In such
                circumstances, Trustexfussion.com Exchange may not have sufficient demand to meet your request to execute
                such a transaction. Placing contingent orders, such as a “stop” or “limit” order does not guarantee your
                potential loss will be limited to an intended amount, as market conditions may make it difficult to
                execute such orders. You may suffer losses due to orders executing at lower or higher values than
                anticipated or requested. <br>
                g. Virtual Currency transactions may not be reversible. Once you send Virtual Currency to an address,
                you may lose access to your Virtual Currency temporarily or indefinitely. For example, an address may
                have been entered incorrectly, or an address may belong to an entity that will not return your Virtual
                Currency. Virtual Currency mistakenly sent to an address we control may not be recoverable.
                By using the Services, you agree that the data sources that maintain your accounts and any third parties
                that interact with your Credentials or account data in connection with our service are not liable for
                any loss, theft, compromise, or misuse whatsoever in connection with our services (including
                negligence), except to the extent such liability cannot be limited under applicable law.
                Data sources make no warranties of any kind related to the data provided by our services--whether
                express, implied, statutory, or otherwise. No data provided by us is an official record of any of your
                accounts.
